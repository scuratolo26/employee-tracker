# Employee Tracker
This is a Node.js application that uses Inquirer, Console Table and MySQL2. This application allows the user to manage their employees. There is a 'Company' database that includes three tables, department, role, and employee. The database is pre-populated with a seeds.sql file. From the terminal the user has many options, view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add department, add role, add employee, update employee role, and exit the application.
